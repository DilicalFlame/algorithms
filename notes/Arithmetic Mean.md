# Arithmetic Mean

## Definition
The arithmetic mean is the sum of all values divided by the count of values. It represents the "central" value of a finite set of numbers.

## Formula
$$ \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} $$

Where:
- $x_i$ are the data points
- $n$ is the total number of items

## Complexity
- **Time**: $O(n)$ - iterates through all data points.
- **Space**: $O(1)$ - only stores the sum.

## Pros & Cons
- **Pros**: Uses every value in the data.
- **Cons**: Highly sensitive to outliers (extreme values).
